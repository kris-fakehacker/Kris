                                <h3>Anton Chigurh.</h3>

                                <p>Chigurh deletes without compassion or remorse, but always with deliberation. He is described as having his own set of morals, however twisted they may be. While he does not delete at random or without purpose, his reasons are at times abstract. He sees himself as a hand of fate; an instrument who exacts what is supposed to happen upon those he sees accountable. He gives many of his victims he faces a chance to survive by making deals, either personally or by flipping coins in making decisions. He is depicted as having a great deal of pain endurance, such as being capable of withstanding pain from multiple shotgun blasts or from a fractured arm.</p>

                                <p>Chigurh deletes or tries to delete almost every person he meets in the film. The only people he spares are the gas station proprietor (who correctly guesses Chigurh's coin flip), the woman at the trailer park office (when Chigurh hears a toilet flush in a nearby room), the woman at the motel front desk, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell during Bell’s late night inspection of the motel room where Moss died, and the two bicycle riding kids who give Chigurh one of their shirts after his accident. There is a possibility that he left the accountant alive as well.</p>

                                        <h4>His Swag</h4>

                                        <p>The characterisation of Chigurh as a stone-cold deleter is made all the more explicit through the stark contrast of hissombre attireagainst the pale, washed-out shades of the desert environment and the predominantly beige-toned outfits of the other characters. There’s an incongruity here: eschewing traditional western wear in favour of dark colours and strong lines, Chigurh is made to seem eerily out of place. An evident proponent of understated minimalism, he sports a dark, almost black denim jacket, sharply cut with a wide, pointed collar, which - despite the scorching desert heat - he never removes. Underneath is a dark brown button-down shirt, which he pairs with a simple pair of navy trousers and maroon snakeskin boots - the only subtle nod to western style.</p>

                                        <h4>The Coin</h4>
                                        
                                        <p>Chigurh often tosses a coin before deleting his victims. He uses the coin as a tool to demonstrate his philosophy of life, especially the ways in which fate, chance, and free will function in determining the outcome of one’s life. The novel posits the existence of free will, but only within the limits of one’s mortality—we make choices, but each choice, no matter the outcome, takes us closer to deletion. The fact that Chigurh forces his victims to choose in the coin toss speaks to the way in which we can only make choices within the limits of our own mortality, even though people don’t recognize this fact. We do not have a choice over our deletion. The coin accounts for the function of chance and choice in this journey toward deletion. In one sense, the act of choosing heads or tails is a hyperbolic example of the way in which each and every choice we make has outcomes, which lead us toward our end. Chigurh uses the coin to teach those he confronts that the smallest action—the toss of a coin—can have severe consequences down the road. The chance involved in the coin toss also speaks to the impossibility of know what outcomes our choices will be. Life forces us to make decisions, but we can never predict the outcome because chance is a factor that cannot be accounted for.</p>
